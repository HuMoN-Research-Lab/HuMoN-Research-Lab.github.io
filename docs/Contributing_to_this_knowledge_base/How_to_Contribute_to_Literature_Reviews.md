# Workflow for Literature Reviews  
Let's capture the important pieces of papers we read. Below is a flexible framework for you to capture notes after you read them. As you write this, keep in mind making this searchable for our future selves.
## 1. Title
## 2. Date, Authors, Universities
## 3. General research category
## 4. What question(s) were they trying to answer?
## 5. How did they attempt to answer their question?
## 6. Any noteworthy results?
## 7. How could this research be relevant to ours?
