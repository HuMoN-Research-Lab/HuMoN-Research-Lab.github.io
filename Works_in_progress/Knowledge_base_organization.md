# How do we want to organize this knowledge base? 

## Literature Library  
1. Harder but classier: 
- Embed actual pdf's using absolute/relative paths to uploaded pdfs in the repo itself? 
- [Here's a guide to do this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69237778/how-to-embed-a-local-pdf-file-in-mkdocs-generated-website-on-github-pages)
2. Easier but less classy? 
- Write a summary of the article using [this workflow](../docs/Contributing_to_this_knowledge_base/Literature_Reviews.md).
- Simply add a webpage link to the article. (potential problem with this is journal access).
3. An In between option, seams easy-ish: 
- Link the web version of the original publication and then Embed snippets of it into our docs using [this guide](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/)
